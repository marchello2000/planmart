# PlanMart

For this homework we are creating the next great online shopping super store PlanMart! We need you to 
implement the order processing and validation system.  You are provided with a set of classes representing
an `Order` and are expected to create an implementation of the interface `IOrderProcessor` (C#) or 
`OrderProcessor` (Java).  This interface simply defines one method:

**C#**

    bool ProcessOrder(Order order);

**Java**

	boolean processOrder(Order order);
	
You are expected to perform two tasks in this method:
* Return true or false depending on whether the order is valid
* Add zero or more line items to the order representing details such as taxes, shipping costs, and reward points.

## Specification

Here are the rules the implementation must enforce:

* All items are taxed at 8% unless exempt

    * Food items shipped to CA, NY
